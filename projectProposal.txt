Description of the Project You are working on:
We are working on a Library Book Management System website for a college or a school. The functionalities of the project can be divided into two parts, admin/librarian functionalities and student functionalities.
Admin/Librarian functionalities:
•	View all the books or a single book.
•	View all the users or a single user.
•	Remove or add user.
•	Issue book.
•	Submit book.
•	Change user password.
•	Add or remove a book.
Student functionalities: 
•	View all books or a single book.
•	Request to issue a book.
•	View profile.
Note: upon viewing a book, it will also show if book is available and if not, then who has rented it (for admin only) and when is the return date. And a student’s profile will show all the books she/he has currently rented.
Tell me about your mongodb Database: 
Our MongoDb database for the book management system will consists of 2 collections, one for the users and other for the books. The user’s collection will have data for students as well as the librarian/admin. While the book’s collection will have data about the book, like author, description, etc.
How many collections you have? 
We have 2 collections, which are for users’ information and books’ information. 

What will be the name of the collections?
Users and Books.
What kind of data will be in the collections?
